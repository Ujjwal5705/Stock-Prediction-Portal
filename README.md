# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Prediction Web App

This Stock Prediction Application leverages **Machine Learning** techniques, built using **Keras** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models, and integrated into a powerful **Django** backend framework.

## What It Does ?

The application predicts future stock prices by analyzing:

- ðŸ“Š **100-day Moving Average**
- ðŸ“Š **200-day Moving Average**

These are key technical indicators widely used by traders and financial analysts to make informed investment decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Django** â€“ Backend framework
- **Keras** â€“ Deep learning library
- **LSTM** â€“ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for time series prediction
- **Pandas** - Pandas is a powerfull open-source library, used for Data Manipulation and and Analysis in python.
- **NumPy** - NumPy is a python library that can perform mathematical and statistical operations on large numerical data.
- **Matplotlib** - Matplotlib is a python library, primarily designed to visualise data in the form of charts and plots.

## What is Machine Learning ?
- Machine Learning is subset of Artificial Intelligence in which computer learns to predict future events based on the past datasets. Its like teaching patterns to a machine and then it make predictions based on those patterns.
1. Youtube recongnises the type/Genre of videos you like the most and shows up in your feed.
2. Gmail uses a machine learning model which recogises whether a mail is a spam or not.


## Types of Machine Learning
- ### Supervised learning
When we train a machine with correct input as well as output data is known as Supervised learning. It is like teaching a kid to label an animal as "Cat" while showing an actual Cat and asking that question again next day. Once, enough datasets are fed. Machine is given unknown inputs and based on it's past learning, an ouput is predicted.

- ### Unsupervised learning
This is a type of machine learning in which machine is fed with unlabelled data and recognise patterns/structures on its own. It is like givng a bunch of toys to a kid and he/she himself identifies and seperate Tigers, Cats, Dogs etc. based on their body sructure, eye shape, hairs and size. In real world this learning is more beneficial on industrial and institutional level. Banks can feed all the transactions to the model and identify the fraudulent activities.

- ### Reinforcement learning
This is type of machine learning in which computer learns to make better decisions by recieving rewards or penalty for its actions. It's like Clapping for a kid when he/she stand up and stumbles on its own for the first time and discouraging activities like eating sand and breaking toys. This type of learning is mostly used in Self-Driving Cars.

## Classification
Classification is a type of Supervised learning in which main focus is to predict a label or category based on input data.

## Regression
Regression is a type of machine learning in which the ultimate goal is to predict continuous numerical values.

# Understanding the Project
- Stock prices change constantly and are influenced by the numerous factors from the past
- Human Emotions can trigger changes in a stock price
- Follows market trends (upwards and downwards)
- ....many other complex factors

> So, Classification has nothing to do with our problem resolution. Basic Regression can not produce output datasets considering above conditions. To solve this we introduced an extended version of regression, **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model. **LSTMs** are like regression with built-in memory.

> LSTMs can remember and learn from the past events and can predict the stock price. **Stock market data is a Time Series data**. So, the LSTM are specifically designed for such type of data. Therefore, LSTM is the best fit for this project.

### What is a Neural Network ?
- It is a model which mimics Human brain, Networks are created to recognize patterns and make predictions.
- Neural Network is a set of interconnected nodes (neurons) in which the data is fed to train the model which can travel throughout neighbouring nodes.

### Neural Network Architecture
> **Input layer:-** Feed data to neural network.

> **Hidden layers:-** Process and Analyze the input data by extracting features and patterns.

> **Output layer:-** Produce the final result, like a prediction or classification.

> A Simple neural network have only one hidden layer to process feature and patterns from input data. While, A Deep learning neural network have multiple layers.

- A Real life example is Human brain. During rainy season, whenever their is a cloud formation, the images of the those clouds are captured by human eyes and fed to the brain as input data. That input data is then processed via hidden layers of the neural network of our brain and based upon the past events and patterns, our brain assumes that it is likely to experience a rainfall.

### Types of Deep Learning Neural Networks
- **FeedForward neural networks (FNNs) :-** In this neural network, data moves only in one direction i.e. the direction of flow of data doesn't matter. It has no memory. Example: Image Recognition.

</p>

- **Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) :-** RNNs are such type of neural networks in which sequence of data flow matters. It is more sophisticated version of FNNs and has built in short-term memory. Stock market data is time-series i.e. a particular event is tagged with a time and that flow of data matters.

</p>

- **Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) :-** CNNs are mostly used for visual data like images and videos.


> Note:- There are two types of RNN. Vanilla RNN and LSTM RNN. The only difference between them is that LSTM model has super powerfull memory capability as compared to Vanilla.
> It can remember very old events and patterns of a stock, that's why LSTM is the best fit for this project.
