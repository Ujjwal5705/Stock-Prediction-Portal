# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Prediction Web App

This Stock Prediction Application leverages **Machine Learning** techniques, built using **Keras** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models, and integrated into a powerful **Django** backend framework.

## What It Does ?

The application predicts future stock prices by analyzing:

- ðŸ“Š **100-day Moving Average**
- ðŸ“Š **200-day Moving Average**

These are key technical indicators widely used by traders and financial analysts to make informed investment decisions.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Django** â€“ Backend framework
- **Keras** â€“ Deep learning library
- **LSTM** â€“ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for time series prediction
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib** â€“ Data manipulation and visualization

## What is Machine Learning ?
- Machine Learning is subset of Artificial Intelligence in which computer learns to predict future events based on the past datasets. Its like teaching patterns to a machine and then it make predictions based on those patterns.
1. Youtube recongnises the type/Genre of videos you like the most and shows up in your feed.
2. Gmail uses a machine learning model which recogises whether a mail is a spam or not.

## Types of Machine Learning
- ### Supervised learning
When we train a machine with correct input as well as output data is known as Supervised learning. It is like teaching a kid to label an animal as "Cat" while showing an actual Cat and asking that question again next day. Once, enough datasets are fed. Machine is given unknown inputs and based on it's past learning, an ouput is predicted.

- ### Unsupervised learning
This is a type of machine learning in which machine is fed with unlabelled data and recognise patterns/structures on its own. It is like givng a bunch of toys to a kid and he/she himself identifies and seperate Tigers, Cats, Dogs etc. based on their body sructure, eye shape, hairs and size. In real world this learning is more beneficial on industrial and institutional level. Banks can feed all the transactions to the model and identify the fraudulent activities.

- ### Reinforcement learning
This is type of machine learning in which computer learns to make better decisions by recieving rewards or penalty for its actions. It's like Clapping for a kid when he/she stand up and stumbles on its own for the first time and discouraging activities like eating sand and breaking toys. This type of learning is mostly used in Self-Driving Cars.
