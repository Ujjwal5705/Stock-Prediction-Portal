# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Prediction Web App

This Stock Prediction Application leverages **Machine Learning** techniques, built using **Keras** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models, and integrated into a powerful **Django** backend framework.

## What It Does ?

The application predicts future stock prices by analyzing:

- ðŸ“Š **100-day Moving Average**
- ðŸ“Š **200-day Moving Average**

These are key technical indicators widely used by traders and financial analysts to make informed investment decisions.
